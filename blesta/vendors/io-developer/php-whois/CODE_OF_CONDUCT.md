# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
